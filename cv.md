## Summary
My **learning goal** in RS-school - get strong knowledge in frontend development, create several project and expand my employment opportunities  And my **long-term professional goal** - to become a senior Frontend developer.

I am very close to the position of the RS-school that education can be high quality, accessible and free for all. And I would like to take part in the development of this community. I've noticed that from such big city as Nizhny Novgorod, in the course is attended by only about 10 people. I am sure that it is necessary to popularize RS-school in our city and I am ready to take part in it. So, **one of my goals** is to **become a mentor** of the next stages on these courses.

About my character I can say that I am a person who is completely immersed into the current work. Beside the work I spend all free time to learning computer science and upgrade my frontend-developer skills. I’m a pragmatic, usually easy get a new knowledge (especially in computer science). If I don’t understand something, I work hard and do everything to do my job completely. I have analytic skills and it easy to me to systematize information.

## Experience
My developer experience - 9 month. I was zero knowledge when I came to frontend developers courses, which was organized by one of Nizhny Novgorod IT-company. Before the courses end, I was invited to a job as junior frontend developer.

After 3-month adapting period I was assigned to a team that works on the real commercial project. I've upgraded my level by one grade on last assessment. And now I am the assistant of our tech lead on courses with which I self began.
